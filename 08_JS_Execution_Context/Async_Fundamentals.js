// Async Fundamentals

/* 
Javascript is by default synchronous and single threaded language but we can make it async with the help async keyword.

Here will be one javascript engine and it will run our web api.
In web Api there are 4 different APIs:
1.DOM Api for browser.
2.Set timeout() for QUEUE. There is one task Queue so whatever will be here will be 1st inserted to task queue and then run.
3.Set Interval()
4.fetch(): It is additional task queue which has more function's it is also the same Queue in which call back will be inserted and executed.
It is a high proiority Queue.It has also some promises. This Queue will run 1st over setTimeout() normal Queue.
